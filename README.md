# STM32F723E Discovery Kit Quad-SPI Flash Test

This is a bare-metal example demonstrating how to use the STM32's QSPI peripheral to transparently map an external Quad-SPI Flash chip to internal memory space. It's meant to go with a companion blog post about the peripheral.

It targets an STM32F723E Discovery Kit board, which includes a 64MB QSPI Flash chip along with a few other external memories.
